# Nest integration for Home Assistant using Google Authentication

The current Nest integration for Home Assistant requires an API Key, which we can no longer access.

The plugin uses the data available from home.nest.com.

### TODO
 - Add and test data updating; setting temperature, heading mode etc
 - Add live video card
